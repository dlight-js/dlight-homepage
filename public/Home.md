# 🧬 DLight.js

DLight.js is a coooooool web framework!

* ⚡️ Performant
    * Dlight optimizes codes in compiling stage and directly manipulates DOM. Dlight is even faster than vanilla JavaScript code(because sometimes you may not know how to write a fully optimized one).
* 🚲 Simple
    * No more complex hooks towards reactivity, only use @State, and dep-chain will help you do the rest.
    * Dlight provides context managing power by default.
* 🍼 Friendly
    * Support jsx and jsd(our new domain syntax) to help you write everything in js.
* 🦋 Beautiful
    * Every line of code in DLight is elegant and beautiful!
